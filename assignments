after deleting voting pod =>

-> creates a different pod with different podname.

after deleting worker pod =>

-> creates a different pod with different podname.

after deleting db pod =>

-> lost the connection, when you click cat or dog that data not reflecting in worker pod and always showing 50-50

analysis =>

-> result pod app socket connection towards db has issue. 
-> if we delete result pod. socket connection will be reestablised and the app will be working.


problem with app design => we had socket connection between worker and db.
